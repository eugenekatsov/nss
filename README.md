# nss
Node sample service 

A toy api for local experimenting with an express server running inside a minikube pod with open telemetry tracing written to a text file.

This is simply a node version of the gss backend. To make it work you'll need to change the internal DNS name in the [frontend](https://github.com/eugenekatsov/gss-fe) in nginx.conf to `nss`

## Setup

You'll need the following:
* I use docker desktop [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* to run commands against your cluster [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
* for local kubernetes [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)
* Charts are a great way to deploy and manage releases to your minikube cluster [helm](https://helm.sh)
* to watch pod logs [stern](https://github.com/stern/stern)


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Docker build and tag, then push to docker hub
4. Update the repository name and tag in the helm chart
5. kubectl create secret in our case it's regcred see here https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/
6. Helm install from the root repo directory
7. Verify the pods are up and healthy: `kubectl get pods` or `describe pods`
8. Run `minikube service <YOUR SERVICE NAME> --url` to get the url
9. Use postman or curl to verify things are working by getting/posting to the url
10. To see some tracing run the docker container (on its own not in minikube), exec into it and `cat traces.txt`
11. To see some logs use `stern <YOUR POD NAME>`
12. To have a general overview of your cluster: `minikube dashboard`
